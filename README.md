# password-generator
Chrome extension for domain dependent password generation.


Work in progress.
TODO:
- parse url address (remove www, etc...)
- show derived password in html Form element
- add some CSS an UI

FUTURE:
- (enhancement) use local storage to indicate if the password for the current webpage was already used..
